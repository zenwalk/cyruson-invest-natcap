There is an svn repository for InVEST data files because Mecurial
can't handle large data files.  Make sure you have an svn client installed
(like http://tortoisesvn.net/) and check out the files from:

https://invest-data.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

or if you're not a committing member of that repository try this url:
http://invest-data.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

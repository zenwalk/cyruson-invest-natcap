There is an svn repository for InVEST data files because Mecurial
can't handle large data files.  Make sure you have an svn client installed
(like http://tortoisesvn.net/) and check out the files from:

http://ncp-vancouver.stanford.edu/svn/invest-data

Credentials to commit changes to the datasets:

username: natcap
password: invest

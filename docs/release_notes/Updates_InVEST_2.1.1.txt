Changes in InVEST 2.1.1

General:

This is a minor release which fixes the following defects: 

-A truncation error was fixed on nutrient retention and sedimentation model that involved division by the number of cells in a watershed.  Now correctly calculates floating point division.
-Minor typos were fixed across the user's guide.

This is a minor release of InVEST that addresses numerous minor bugs and performance tweaks in the InVEST 3.0 models.  Including:

 * Performance updates to the carbon model.
 * Nodata masking fix for rarity raster in Biodiversity Model.
    - When computing rarity from a base landuse raster and current or future
      landuse raster, the intersection of the two was not being properly taken.

 * Refactor of Wave Energy Model:
    - Combining the Biophysical and Valuation modules into one.
    - Adding new data for the North Sea.
    - Fixed a bug where elevation values that were equal to or greater than zero
      were being used in calculations.
    - Fixed memory issues when dealing with large datasets.
    - Updated core functions to remove any use of depracated functions

  * Fixed an issue that affected several InVEST models that occured
    when watershed polygons were too small to cover a pixel.  Excessively
    small watersheds are now handled correctly
    

Known Issues:

  * Flow routing in the standalone sediment and nutrient models has a
    bug that prevents routing in several landscapes.  We're not
    certain of the nature of the bug at the moment, but we will fix by
    the next release.  Thus, sediment and nutrient models are marked
    as (beta) since in some cases the DEM routes correctly.

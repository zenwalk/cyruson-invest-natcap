This is a minor release of InVEST that addresses numerous minor bugs and performance tweaks in the InVEST 3.0 models.  Including:

 * Refactor of Wave Energy Model:
    - Combining the Biophysical and Valuation modules into one.
    - Adding new data for the North Sea and Australia
    - Fixed a bug where elevation values that were equal to or greater than zero
      were being used in calculations.
    - Fixed memory issues when dealing with large datasets.
    - Updated core functions to remove any use of depracated functions

 * Performance updates to the carbon model.

 * Nodata masking fix for rarity raster in Biodiversity Model.
    - When computing rarity from a base landuse raster and current or future
      landuse raster, the intersection of the two was not being properly taken.

 * Fixes to the flow routing algorithms in the sediment and nutrient
   retention models in cases where stream layers were burned in by ArcGIS
   hydro tools.  In those cases streams were at the same elevation and caused
   routing issues.

 * Fixed an issue that affected several InVEST models that occured
   when watershed polygons were too small to cover a pixel.  Excessively
   small watersheds are now handled correctly

 * Arc model deprecation.  We are deprecating the following ArcGIS versions
   of our InVEST models in the sense we recommend ALL users use the InVEST
   standalones over the ArcGIS versions, and the existing ArcGIS versions
   of these models will be removed entirely in the next release.
    - Timber
    - Carbon
    - Pollination
    - Biodiversity
    - Finfish Aquaculture

Known Issues:

 * Flow routing in the standalone sediment and nutrient models has a
   bug that prevents routing in several landscapes.  We're not
   certain of the nature of the bug at the moment, but we will fix by
   the next release.  Thus, sediment and nutrient models are marked
   as (beta) since in some cases the DEM routes correctly.

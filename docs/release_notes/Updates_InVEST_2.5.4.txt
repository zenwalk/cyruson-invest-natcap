This is a minor release of InVEST that addresses numerous minor bugs and performance tweaks in the InVEST 3.0 models.  Including:

 * Performance updates to the carbon model.
 * Nodata masking fix for rarity raster in Biodiversity Model.
    - When computing rarity from a base landuse raster and current or future
      landuse raster, the intersection of the two was not being properly taken.

 * Refactor of Wave Energy Model:
    - Combining the Biophysical and Valuation modules into one.
    - Adding new data for the North Sea.
    - Fixed a bug where elevation values that were equal to or greater than zero
      were being used in calculations.
    - Fixed memory issues when dealing with large datasets.
    - Updated core functions to remove any use of depracated functions

This is a minor release of InVEST that addresses numerous minor bugs and performance tweaks in the InVEST 3.0 models.  Including:

 * Performance updates to the carbon model.
 * Nodata masking fix for rarity raster in Biodiversity Model.
    - When computing rarity from a base landuse raster and current or future
      landuse raster, the intersection of the two was not being properly taken.

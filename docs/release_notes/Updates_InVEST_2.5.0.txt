This a major release of InVEST that includes new standalone versions (ArcGIS
is not required) our models as well as additional functionality, stability, 
and increased performance to many of the existing models.  This release is
timed to support our group's annual training event at Stanford University.
We expect to release InVEST 2.5.1 a couple of weeks after to address any
software issues that arise during the training.  See the release notes
below for details of the release, and please contact richsharp@stanford.edu
for any issues relating to software:

  - *new* Sediment 3.0 Beta:
      - This is a standalone model that executes an order of magnitude faster
        than the original ArcGIS model, but may have memory issues with 
	larger datasets. This fix is scheduled for the 2.5.1 release of InVEST.
      - Uses a d-infinity flow algorithm (ArcGIS version uses D8).
      - Includes a more accurate LS factor.
      - Outputs are now summarized by polygon rather than rasterized polygons.
        Users can view results directly as a table rather than sampling a
	GIS raster.
  - *new* Nutrient 3.0 Beta:
      - This is a standalone model that executes an order of magnitude faster
        than the original ArcGIS model, but may have memory issues with 
	larger datasets. This fix is scheduled for the 2.5.1 release of InVEST.

  - *new* Wind Energy:
      - A new offshore wind energy model.  This is a standalone-only model
        available under the windows start menu.
  - *new* Recreation Alpha:
      - This is a working demo of our soon to be released future land and near
        shore recreation model.  The model itself is incomplete and should only
	be used as a demo or by NatCap partners that know what they're doing.
  - *new* Habitat Risk Assessment 3.0 Alpha:
      - This is a working demo of our soon to be released 3.0 version of habitat
        risk assessment.  The model itself is incomplete and should only
	be used as a demo or by NatCap partners that know what they're doing.
	Users that need to use the habitat risk assessment should use the ArcGIS
	version of this model.
      
  - Improvements to the InVEST 2.x ArcGIS-based toolset:
      - Bug fixes to the ArcGIS based Coastal Protection toolset.

  - Removed support for the ArcGIS invest_VERSION.mxd map.  We expect to
    transition the InVEST toolset exclusive standalone tools in a few months.  In
    preparation of this we are starting to deprecate parts of our old ArcGIS
    toolset including this ArcMap document.  The InVEST ArcToolbox is still
    available in C:\InVEST_2_5_0\invest_250.tbx.

  - Known issues:

    - The InVEST 3.0 standalones generate open source GeoTiffs as
      outputs rather than the proprietary ESRI Grid format.  ArcGIS 9.3.1
      occasionally displays these rasters incorrectly.  We have found
      that these layers can be visualized in ArcGIS 9.3.1 by following 
      convoluted steps: Right Click on the layer and select Properties; click on
      the Symbology tab; select Stretch, agree to calculate a histogram (this will
      create an .aux file that Arc can use for visualization), click "Ok", remove
      the raster from the layer list, then add it back. As an alternative, we
      suggest using an open source GIS Desktop Tool like Quantum GIS or ArcGIS
      version 10.0 or greater.

   - The InVEST 3.0 carbon model will generate inaccurate sequestration results
     if the extents of the current and future maps don't align.  This will be
     fixed in InVEST 2.5.1; in the meanwhile a workaround is to clip both LULCs
     so they have identical overlaps.

   - A user reported an unstable run of InVEST 3.0 water yield.  We are not
     certain what is causing the issue, but we do have a fix that will go out
     in InVEST 2.5.1.
   
   - At the moment the InVEST standalones do now run on Windows XP.  This appears
     to be related to an incompatibility between Windows XP and GDAL, the an open
     source gis library we use to create and read GIS data.  At the moment we are
     uncertain if we will be able to fix this bug in future releases, but will
     pass along more information in the future.

This a major release of InVEST that adds new 3.0 versions of our models as
well as additional functionality, stability, and increased performance to
many of the existing models.  The timing of this release corresponds with
our group's annual training at Stanford University.  We expect to release
InVEST 2.5.1 in a couple of weeks to address any expected (but currently
unknown) issues that arise during the training.  See the release notes
below for details of the release:

  - Sediment 3.0 Beta:
      - This is a standalone model that executes an order of magnitude faster
        than the original ArcGIS model, but may have memory issues with 
	larger datasets. This fix is scheduled for the 2.5.1 release of InVEST.
      - Uses a d-infinity flow algorithm (ArcGIS version uses D8).
      - Includes a more accurate LS factor.
      - Outputs are now summaried by polygon rather than rasterized polygons.
        Users can view results directly as a table rather than sampling a
	GIS raster.
  - Nutrient 3.0 Beta:
      - This is a standalone model that executes an order of magnitude faster
        than the original ArcGIS model, but may have memory issues with 
	larger datasets. This fix is scheduled for the 2.5.1 release of InVEST.

  - Wind Energy:
      - A new offshore wind energy model.  This is a standalone-only model
        available under the windows start menu.
  - Recreation Alpha:
      - This is a working demo of our soon to be released future land and near
        shore recreation model.  The model itself is incomplete and should only
	be used as a demo or by NatCap partners that know what they're doing.
  - Habitat Risk Assessment 3.0 Alpha:
      - This is a working demo of our soon to be released 3.0 version of habitat
        risk asssessment.  The model itself is incomplete and should only
	be used as a demo or by NatCap partners that know what they're doing.
	Users that need to use the habitat risk assessment should use the ArcGIS
	version of this model.
      
  - Improvements to the InVEST 2.x ArcGIS-based toolset:
      - Bug fixes to the ArcGIS based Coastal Protection toolset.

  - Removed support for the ArcGIS invest_VERSION.mxd map.  We expect to fully
    transition the InVEST toolset to standlone tools in a few months.  In
    preparation of this we are starting to depricate parts of our old ArcGIS
    toolset including this ArcMap document.  The InVEST ArcToolbox is still
    availble in C:\InVEST_2_5_0\invest_250.tbx.

  - Known issues: 

    - The InVEST 3.0 standalones generate open source GeoTiffs as
      outputs rather than the proprietary ESRI Grid format.  ArcGIS 9.3.1 
      occasionally displays these rasters incorrectly.  We have found
      that these layers can be visualized in ArcGIS 9.3.1 by following 
      convoluted steps: Right Click on the layer and select Properties; click on
      the Symbology tab; select Strech, agree to calcualte a histogram (this will
      create an .aux file that Arc can use for visualization), click "Ok", remove
      the raster from the layer list, then add it back. As an alternative, we
      suggest using an open source GIS Desktop Tool like Quantum GIS or ArcGIS
      version 10.0 or greater. 

   - The InVEST 3.0 carbon model will generate inaccruate sequestration results
     if the extents of the current and future maps don't align.  This will be
     fixed in InVEST 2.5.1; in the meanwhile a workaround is to clip both LULCs
     so they have identical overlaps.

   - A user reported an unstable run of InVEST 3.0 water yield.  We are not
     certain what is causing the issue, but we do have a fix that will go out
     in InVEST 2.5.1.
   
   - Windows XP users report issues running the InVEST standalones.  We have
     attempted to fix this issue although our development team is unable to verify
     the fix because we don't have access to Windows XP.  Feedback from users would	
     be helpful.

Changes in InVEST 2.2.0

This is a major release which adds a Tier 1 coastal protection model to the
marine set of InVEST tools.

Additionally, we are introducing our InVEST 3.0 beta platform as a separate
toolbox.  You'll see it in the install directory as InVEST30.tbx, or if
you open the InVEST220.mxd ArcMap Document, you'll see it as a subtoolbox in
the InVEST 2.2.0 toolbox named "InVEST 3.0 Beta".  Currently it holds beta
versions of our carbon and managed timber production InVEST models.  To launch
an InVEST 3.0 beta tool, double click on the desired tool in the InVEST 3.0 
toolbox then click "Ok" on the Arc toolbox screen that opens; the InVEST 3.0
beta tool will launch after this.  These tools are very similar to the 
InVEST 2.2.0 versions of the tools with the following modifications:

InVEST 3.0 Carbon:
  * Fixes a minor bug in the 2.2 version that ignored floating point values
    in carbon pool inputs.
  * Separation of carbon model into a biophysical and valuation model.
  * Calculates carbon storage and sequestration at the minimum resolution of
    the input maps.
  * Runtime efficiency improved by an order of magnitude.
  * User interface streamlined including dynamic activation of inputs based
    on user preference, direct link to documentation, and recall of inputs
    based on user's previous run.
    
InVEST 3.0 Timber:
  * User interface streamlined including dynamic activation of inputs based
    on user preference, direct link to documentation, and recall of inputs
    based on user's previous run.

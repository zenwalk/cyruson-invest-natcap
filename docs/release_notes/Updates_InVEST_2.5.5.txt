The 2.5.5 release of InVEST that addresses minor bugs, performance
tweaks, and new functionality of the InVEST standalone models.  Including:

 * Production level release of the 3.0 Coastal Vulnerability model.
    - This upgrades the InVEST 2.5.4 version of the beta standalone CV
      to a full release with full users guide.  This version of the 
      CV model should be used in all cases over its ArcGIS equivalent.

 * Production level release of the Habitat Risk Assessment model.
    - This release upgrades the InVEST 2.5.4 beta version of the
      standalone habitat risk assessment model. It should be used in 
      all cases over its ArcGIS equivalent.

 * Uncertainty analysis in Carbon model (beta) 
    - Added functionality to assess uncertainty in sequestration and
      emissions given known uncertainty in carbon pool stocks.  Users
      can now specify standard  deviations of carbon pools with
      normal distributions as well as desired uncertainty levels.
      New outputs include masks for regions which both sequester and
      emit carbon with a high probability of confidence.  Please see
      the "Uncertainty Analysis" section of the carbon user's guide
      chapter for more information.

 * REDD+ Scenario Analysis in Carbon model (beta)
    - Additional functionality to assist users evaluating REDD
      and REDD+ scenarios in the carbon model.  The uncertainty analysis
      functionality can also be used with these scenarios.
      Please see the "REDD Scenario Analysis" section of the
      carbon user's guide chapter for more information.

 * Uncertainty analysis in Finfish Aquaculture model (beta)
    - Additionally functionality to account for uncertainty in
      alpha and beta growth parameters as well as histogram
      plots showing the distribution of harvest weights and
      net present value.   Uncertainty analysis is performed
      through Monte Carlo runs that normally sample the
      growth parameters.

 * Streamlined Nutrient Retention model functionality
    - The nutrient retention module no longer requires users to explicitly
      run the water yield model.  The model now seamlessly runs water yield
      during execution.

 * Beta release of the recreation model
    - The recreation is available for beta use with limited documentation.

Known Issues:

 * Flow routing in the standalone sediment and nutrient models has a
   bug that prevents routing in some (not all) landscapes.  This bug is 
   related to resolving d-infinity flow directions across flat areas.
   We are implementing the solution in Garbrecht and Martx (1997).
   In the meanwhile the sediment and nutrient models are still marked
   as beta until this issue is resolved.

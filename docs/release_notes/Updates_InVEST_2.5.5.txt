This is a minor release of InVEST that addresses numerous minor bugs 
and performance tweaks, and new functionality of the InVEST 3.0
models.  Including:

 * Production level release of the 3.0 Coastal Vulnerability model.
    - This upgrades the InVEST 2.5.4 version of the standalone CV
      to our production level release with a full users guide.
    - The standalone version of the CV model now deprecates the
      ArcGIS equivalent.

 * Production level release of the Habitat Risk Assessment model.
    - This release includes a production quality version of the
      standalone habitat risk assessment model. It deprecates
      the ArcGIS equivalent.

 * Uncertainty analysis in Carbon model (beta)
    - We have added functionality to assess uncertainty in 
      sequestration and emissions given uncertainty in carbon
      pool stocks.

 * REDD+ Scenario Analysis in Carbon model (beta)
    - We have added functionality to assist users in running REDD
      and REDD+ scenarios in the carbon model.  The scenarios
      also include the uncertainty analysis added to the
      carbon model on this release.

 * Uncertainty analysis in Finfish Aquaculture model (beta)
    - Additionally functionality to account for uncertainty in
      alpha and beta growth parameters as well as histogram
      plots showing the distribution of harvest weights and
      net present value.

 * Streamlined Nutrient Retention model functionality
    - The nutrient retention module no longer requires users to explicitly
      run the water yield model first.  Instead the model runs
      the InVEST water yield model seamlessly as part of the execution.

Known Issues:

 * Flow routing in the standalone sediment and nutrient models has a
   bug that prevents routing in some (not all) landscapes.  This bug is 
   related to resolving d-infinity flow directions across flat areas.
   We are implementing the solution in Garbrecht and Martx (1997).
   In the meanwhile the sediment and nutrient models are still marked
   as beta until this issue is resolved.

Updates to InVEST Beta

InVEST 2.1 – Beta

Changes in InVEST 2.1


General:

1.	InVEST versioning
We have altered our versioning scheme.  Integer changes will reflect major changes (e.g. the addition of marine models warranted moving from 1.x to 2.0).  An increment in the digit after the primary decimal indicates major new features (e.g the addition of a new model) or major revisions.  For example, this release is numbered InVEST 2.1 because two new models are included).  We will add another decimal to reflect minor feature revisions or bug fixes.  For example, InVEST 2.1.1 will likely be out soon as we are continually working to improve our tool.
2.	HTML guide
With this release, we have migrated the entire InVEST users’ guide to an HTML format.  The HTML version will output a pdf version for use off-line, printing, etc. 


MARINE MODELS
############################################################################


1.Marine Python Extension Check

-This tool has been updated to allow users to select the marine models they intend to run.  Based on this selection, it will provide a summary of which Python and ArcGIS extensions are necessary and if the Python extensions have been successfully installed on the user’s machine.


2.Grid the Seascape (GS)

-This tool has been created to allow marine model users to generate an seascape analysis grid within a specified area of interest (AOI).

-It only requires an AOI and cell size (in meters) as inputs, and produces a polygon grid which can be used as inputs for the Habitat Risk Assessment and Overlap Analysis models.


3. Coastal Protection

- This is now a two-part model for assessing Coastal Vulnerability.  The first part is a tool for calculating fetch and the second maps the value of a Vulnerability Index, which differentiates areas with relatively high or low exposure to erosion and inundation during storms.

- The model has been updated to now incorporate coastal relief and the protective influence of up to eight natural habitat input layers.

- A global Wave Watch 3 dataset is also provided to allow users to quickly generate rankings for wind and wave exposure worldwide.


4. Habitat Risk Assessment (HRA)

This new model allows users to assess the risk posed to coastal and marine habitats by human activities and the potential consequences of exposure for the delivery of ecosystem services and biodiversity.  The HRA model is suited to screening the risk of current and future human activities in order to prioritize management strategies that best mitigate risk. 


5. Overlap Analysis

This new model maps current human uses in and around the seascape and summarizes the relative importance of various regions for particular activities.  The model was designed to produce maps that can be used to identify marine and coastal areas that are most important for human use, in particular recreation and fisheries, but also other activities.



FRESHWATER MODELS
############################################################################

All Freshwater models now support ArcMap 10.


Sample data:

1. Bug fix for error in Water_Tables.mdb Biophysical table where many field values were shifted over one column relative to the correct field name.

2. Bug fix for incorrect units in erosivity layer.


Hydropower:

1.In Water Yield, new output tables have been added containing mean biophysical outputs (precipitation, actual and potential evapotranspiration, water yield)  for each watershed and sub-watershed.


Water Purification:

1. The Water Purification Threshold table now allows users to specify separate thresholds for nitrogen and phosphorus.   Field names thresh_n and thresh_p replace the old ann_load.

2. The Nutrient Retention output tables nutrient_watershed.dbf and nutrient_subwatershed.dbf now include a column for nutrient retention per watershed/sub-watershed.

3. In Nutrient Retention, some output file names have changed.

4. The user's guide has been updated to explain more accurately the inclusion of thresholds in the biophysical service estimates.


Sedimentation:

1. The Soil Loss output tables sediment_watershed.dbf and sediment_subwatershed.dbf now include a column for sediment retention per watershed/sub-watershed.

2. In Soil Loss, some output file names have changed.

3. The default input value for Slope Threshold is now 75.

4. The user's guide has been updated to explain more accurately the inclusion of thresholds in the biophysical service estimates.

5. Valuation: Bug fix where the present value was not being applied correctly.

Updates to InVEST Beta

InVEST 2.0 – Beta

Changes in InVEST 2.0


InVEST 1.005 is a minor release with the following modification:

1. Aesthetic Quality
 
This new model allows users to determine the locations from which new nearshore or offshore features can be seen.  It generates viewshed maps that can be used to identify the visual footprint of new offshore development.  
 

2. Coastal Vulnerability

This new model produces maps of coastal human populations and a coastal exposure to erosion and inundation index map.  These outputs can be used to understand the relative contributions of different variables to coastal exposure and to highlight the protective services offered by natural habitats. 


3. Aquaculture

This new model is used to evaluate how human activities (e.g., addition or removal of farms, changes in harvest management practices) and climate change (e.g., change in sea surface temperature) may affect the production and economic value of aquacultured Atlantic salmon.  


4. Wave Energy

This new model provides spatially explicit information, showing potential areas for siting Wave Energy conversion (WEC) facilities with the greatest energy production and value.  This site- and device-specific information for the WEC facilities can then be used to identify and quantify potential trade-offs that may arise when siting WEC facilities.


5. Avoided Reservoir Sedimentation

-The name of this model has been changed to the Sediment Retention model. 

-We have added a water quality valuation model for sediment retention. The user now has the option to select avoided dredge cost analysis, avoided water treatment cost analysis or both.  The water quality valuation approach is the same as that used in the Water Purification: Nutrient Retention model.
 
-The threshold information for allowed sediment loads (TMDL, dead volume, etc.) are now input in a stand alone table instead of being included in the valuation table. This adjusts the biophysical service output for any social allowance of pollution. Previously, the adjustment was only done in the valuation model.

-The watersheds and sub-watershed layers are now input as shapefiles instead of rasters.

-Final outputs are now aggregated to the sub-basin scale. The user must input a sub-basin shapefile. We provide the Hydro 1K dataset as a starting option. See users guide for changes to many file output names.

-Users are strongly advised not to interpret pixel-scale outputs for hydrological understanding or decision-making of any kind. Pixel outputs should only be used for calibration/validation or model checking.


6. Hydropower Production

-The watersheds and sub-watershed layers are now input as shapefiles instead of rasters.

-Final outputs are now aggregated to the sub-basin scale. The user must input a sub-basin shapefile. We provide the Hydro 1K dataset as a starting option. See users guide for changes to many file output names.

-Users are strongly advised not to interpret pixel-scale outputs for hydrological understanding or decision-making of any kind. Pixel outputs should only be used for calibration/validation or model checking.

-The calibration constant for each watershed is now input in a stand-alone table instead of being included in the valuation table. This makes running the water scarcity model simpler. 


7. Water Purification: Nutrient Retention

-The threshold information for allowed pollutant levels (TMDL, etc.) are now input in a stand alone table instead of being included in the valuation table. This adjusts the biophysical service output for any social allowance of pollution. Previously, the adjustment was only done in the valuation model.

-The watersheds and sub-watershed layers are now input as shapefiles instead of rasters.

-Final outputs are now aggregated to the sub-basin scale. The user must input a sub-basin shapefile. We provide the Hydro 1K dataset as a starting option. See users guide for changes to many file output names.

-Users are strongly advised not to interpret pixel-scale outputs for hydrological understanding or decision-making of any kind. Pixel outputs should only be used for calibration/validation or model checking.


8. Carbon Storage and Sequestration

The model now outputs an aggregate sum of the carbon storage.


9. Habitat Quality and Rarity

This model had an error while running ReclassByACII if the land cover codes were not sorted alphabetically.  This has now been corrected and it sorts the reclass file before running the reclassification

The model now outputs an aggregate sum of the habitat quality.

10. Pollination

In this version, the pollination model accepts an additional parameter which indicated the proportion of a crops yield that is attributed to wild pollinators.

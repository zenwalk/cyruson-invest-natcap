This is a minor release of InVEST that does not add any new models, but
does add additional functionality, stability, and increased performance to
one of the InVEST 3.0 standalones:

  - Pollination 3.0 Beta:
        - Fixed a bug where Windows users of InVEST could run the model, but
          most raster outputs were filled with nodata values.

Additionally, this minor release fixes a bug in the InVEST user interface where
collapsible containers became entirely non-interactive.

* Blue Carbon model released.

* HRA UI now properly reflects that the Resolution of Analysis is in meters, not meters squared, and thus will be applied as a side length for a raster pixel.

* HRA now accepts CSVs for ratings scoring that are semicolon separated as well as comma separated.

* Fixed a minor bug in InVEST’s geoprocessing aggregate core that now consistently outputs correct zonal stats from the underlying pixel level hydro outputs which affects the water yield, sediment, and nutrient models.

* Added compression to InVEST output geotiff files.  In most cases this reduces output disk usage by a factor of 5.

* Fixed an issue where CSVs in the sediment model weren’t open in universal line read mode.

* Fixed an issue where approximating whether pixel edges were the same size was not doing an approximately equal function.

* Fixed an issue that made the CV model crash when the coastline computed from the landmass didn’t align perfectly with that defined in the geomorphology layer.

* Fixed an issue in the CV model where the intensity of local wave exposure was very low, and yielded zero local wave power for the majority of coastal segments.

* Fixed an issue where the CV model crashes if a coastal segment is at the edge of the shore exposure raster.

* Fixed the exposure of segments surrounded by land that appeared as exposed when their depth was zero.

* Fixed an issue in the CV model where the natural habitat values less than 5 were one unit too low, leading to negative habitat values in some cases.

* Fixed an exponent issue in the CV model where the coastal vulnerability index was raised to a power that was too high.

* Fixed a bug in the Scenic Quality model that prevented it from starting, as well as a number of other issues.

* Updated the pollination model to conform with the latest InVEST geoprocessing standards, resulting in an approximately 33% speedup.

* Improved the UI’s ability to remember the last folder visited, and to have all file and folder selection dialogs have access to this information.
  
* Fixed an issue in Marine Water Quality where the UV points were supposed to be optional, but instead raised an exception when not passed in.

The 2.5.6 release of InVEST that addresses minor bugs, performance
tweaks, and new functionality of the InVEST standalone models.
Including:

* Change the changed the Carbon biophysical table to use code field
  name from LULC to lucode so it is consistent with the InVEST water
  yield biophysical table.

* Replaced sample data in overlap analysis that was causing the model
  to crash.

* Updates to the overlap analysis user’s guide.

* Added preprocessing toolkit available under 
  C:\{InVEST install directory}\utils

* Biodiversity Model now exits gracefully if a threat raster is not
  found in the input folder.

* Wind Energy now uses linear (bilinear because its over 2D space?)
  interpolation.

* Wind Energy has been refactored to current API.

* Potential Evapotranspiration input has been properly named to
  Reference Evapotranspiration.

* PET_mn for Water Yield is now Ref Evapotranspiration times Kc
  (evapotranspiration coefficient).

* The soil depth field has been renamed “depth to root restricting
  layer” in both the hydropower and nutrient retention models.

* ETK column in biophysical table for Water Yield is now Kc.

* Added help text to Timber model.

* Changed the behavior of nutrient retention to return nodata values
  when the mean runoff index is zero.

* Fixed an issue where the hydropower model didn’t use the suffix
  inputs.

* Fixed a bug in Biodiversity that did not allow for numerals in the
  threat names and rasters.

* Updated routing algorithm to use a modern algorithm for plateau
  direction resolution.

* Fixed an issue in HRA where individual risk pixels weren’t being
  calculated correctly.

* HRA will now properly detect in the preprocessed CSVs when criteria
  or entire habitat-stressor pairs are not desired within an
  assessment..

* Added an infrastructure feature so that temporary files are created
  in the user’s workspace rather than at the system level
  folder.  This lets users work in a secondary workspace on a USB
  attached hard drive and use the space of that drive, rather than the
  primary operating system drive.

Changes in InVEST 2.3.0

General:

This is a major release which releases several beta versions of the
InVEST models in the InVEST 3.0 framework.  These models run as
standalones, but a GIS platform is needed to edit and view the data
inputs and outputs.  Until InVEST 3.0 is released the original ArcGIS
based versions of these tools will remain the release.

Existing InVEST models migrated to the 3.0 framework in this release
include:

-Reservoir Hydropower Production 3.0 beta
-Wave Energy 3.0 beta
 -Runtimes for non-global runs decreased by a factor of 7
 -Minor bugs in interpolation that exist in the 2.x model is fixed in 
  3.0 beta.
-Crop Pollination 3.0 beta
 -Runtimes decreased by a factor of over 10,000

This release also includes the new models which only exist in the 3.0
framework:

-Marine Water Quality 3.0 alpha with a preliminary  user's guide.

InVEST models in the 3.0 framework from previous releases that now
have a standalone executable include: 

-Managed Timber Production Model
-Carbon Storage and Sequestration

Additionally there are a handful of other minor fixes and feature
enhancements since the previous release:

-Minor bug fix to 2.x sedimentation model that now correctly
 calculates slope exponentials.
-Minor fixes to several chapters in the user's guide.
-The 3.0 version of the Carbon model now can value the price of carbon
 in metric tons of C or CO2.
-Other minor bug fixes and runtime performance tweaks in the 3.0 framework.

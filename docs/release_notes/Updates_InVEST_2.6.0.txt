The 2.6.0 release of InVEST removes most of the old InVEST models from the Arc toolbox in favor of the new InVEST standalone models.  While we have been developing standalone equivalents for the InVEST Arc models since version 2.3.0, this is the first release in which we removed support for the deprecated ArcGIS versions after an internal review of correctness, performance, and stability on the standalones.  Additionally, this is one of the last milestones before the InVEST 3.0.0 release later next year which will transition InVEST models away from strict ArcGIS dependence to a standalone form.

Specifically, support for the following models have been moved from the ArcGIS toolbox to their Windows based standalones: (1) hydropower/water yield, (2) finfish aquaculture, (3) coastal protection tier 0/coastal vulnerability, (4) wave energy, (5) carbon, (6) habitat quality/biodiversity, (7) pollination, (8) timber, and (9) overlap analysis.  Additionally, documentation references to ArcGIS for those models have been replaced with instructions for launching standalone InVEST models from the Windows start menu.

This release also addresses minor bugs, documentation updates, performance tweaks, and new functionality to the toolset, including:

*  A Google doc to provide guidance for scripting the InVEST standalone models: https://docs.google.com/document/d/158WKiSHQ3dBX9C3Kc99HUBic0nzZ3MqW3CmwQgvAqGo/edit?usp=sharing

* Fixed a bug in the sample data that defined Kc as a number between 0 and 1000 instead of a number between 0 and 1.

* Link to report an issue now takes user to the online forums rather than an email address.

* Changed InVEST Sediment model standalone so that retention values are now between 0 and 1 instead of 0 and 100.

* Fixed a bug in Biodiversity where if no suffix were entered output filenames would have a trailing underscore (_) behind them.

* Added documentation to the water purification/nutrient retention model documentation about the standalone outputs since they differ from the ArcGIS version of the model.

* Fixed an issue where the model would try to move the logfile to the workspace after the model run was complete and Windows would erroneously report that the move failed.

* Removed the separation between marine and freshwater terrestrial models in the user’s guide.  Now just a list of models.

* Changed the name of InVEST “Biodiversity” model to “Habitat Quality” in the module names, start menu, user’s guide, and sample data folders.

* Minor bug fixes, performance enhancements, and better error reporting in the internal infrastructure.

* HRA risk in the unstable standalone is calculated differently from the last release. If there is no spatial overlap within a cell, there is automatically a risk of 0. This also applies to the E and C intermediate files for a given pairing. If there is no spatial overlap, E and C will be 0 where there is only habitat. However, we still create a recovery potential raster which has habitat- specific risk values, even without spatial overlap of a stressor. HRA shapefile outputs for high, medium, low risk areas are now calculated using a user-defined maximum number of overlapping stressors, rather than all potential stressors. In the HTML subregion averaged output, we now attribute what portion of risk to a habitat comes from each habitat-stressor pairing. Any pairings which don’t overlap will have an automatic risk of 0.

* Major changes to Water Yield : Reservoir Hydropower Production. Changes include an alternative equation for calculating Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) for non-vegetated land cover types including wetlands. This allows for a more accurate representation of processes on land covers such as urban, water, wetlands, where root depth values aren’t applicable. To differentiate between the two equations a column ‘LULC_veg’ has been added to the Biophysical table in Hydropower/input/biophysical_table.csv. In this column a 1 indicates vegetated and 0 indicates non-vegetated.

* The output structure and outputs have also change in Water Yield : Reservoir Hydropower Production. There is now a folder ‘output’ that contains all output files including a sub directory ‘per_pixel’ which has three pixel raster outputs. The subwatershed results are only calculated for the water yield portion and those results can be found as a shapefile, ‘subwatershed_results.shp’, and CSV file, ‘subwatershed_results.csv’. The watershed results can be found in similar files: watershed_results.shp and watershed_results.csv. These two files for the watershed outputs will aggregate the Scarcity and Valuation results as well.

* The evapotranspiration coefficients for crops, Kc, has been changed to a decimal input value in the biophysical table. These values used to be multiplied by 1000 so that they were in integer format, that pre processing step is no longer necessary.

* Changing support from richsharp@stanford.edu to the user support forums at http://ncp-yamato.stanford.edu/natcapforums.

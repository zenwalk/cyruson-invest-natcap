The 3.0.0 release of InVEST represents a shift away from the ArcGIS to the InVEST standalone computational platform.  The only exception to this shift is the marine coastal protection tier 1 model which is still supported in an ArcGIS toolbox and has no InVEST 3.0 standalone at the moment.  Specific changes are detailed below

* The core water routing algorithms for the sediment and nutrient models have been overhauled.  The routing algorithms now correctly adjust flow in plateau regions, address a bug that would sometimes not route large sections of a DEM, and has been optimized for both run time and memory performance.  In most cases the core d-infinity flow accumulation algorithm out performs TauDEM.  We have also packaged a simple interface to these algorithms in a standalone tool called RouteDEM; the functions can also be referenced from the scripting API in the invest_natcap.routing package.

* The sediment and nutrient models are now at a production level release.  We no longer support the ArcGIS equivalent of these models.

* The sediment model has had its outputs simplified with major changes including the removal of the 'pixel mean' outputs, a direct output of the pixel level export and retention maps, and a single output shapefile whose attribute table contains aggregations of sediment output values.  Additionally all inputs to the sediment biophysical table including p, c, and retention coefficients are now expressed as a proportion between 0 and 1; the ArcGIS model had previously required those inputs were integer values between 0 and 1000.  See the "Interpreting Results" section of sediment model for full details on the outputs.

* The nutrient model has had a similar overhaul to the sediment model including a simplified output structure with many key outputs contained in the attribute table of the shapefile.  Retention coefficients are also expressed in proportions between 0 and 1.  See the "Interpreting Results" section of nutrient model for full details on the outputs.

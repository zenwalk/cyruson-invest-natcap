Changes in InVEST 2.2.2

General:

This is a minor release which fixes the following defects: 

-Fixed an issue with sediment retention model where large watersheds
 allowed loading per cell was incorrectly rounded to integer values.
-Fixed bug where changing the threshold didn't affect the retention output 
 because function was incorrectly rounded to integer values.
-Added total water yield in meters cubed to to output table by watershed.
-Fixed bug where smaller than default (2000) resolutions threw an error about 
 not being able to find the field in "unitynew". With non-default resolution, 
 "unitynew" was created without an attribute table, so force one to be created.
-Removed mention of beta state and ecoinformatics from header of software 
 license.

Changes in InVEST 2.4.0

General:

This is a major release which releases several beta versions of the
InVEST models in the InVEST 3.0 framework.  These models run as
standalones, but a GIS platform is needed to edit and view the data
inputs and outputs.  This release introduces start menu shortcuts for
all available InVEST 3.0 beta models.  The existing InVEST 2.x models
can still be found in the included Arc toolbox.

Existing InVEST models migrated to the 3.0 framework in this release
include:

- Biodiversity 3.0 Beta
  - Minor bug fixes and usability enhancements
  - Runtime decreased by a factor of 210
- Overlap Analysis 3.0 Beta
  - Runtime improvements
  - Minor bug fixes and usability enhancements
  - Split into two separate tools:
    - Overlap Analysis outputs rasters with individually-weighted pixels
    - Overlap Analysis: Management Zones produces a shapefile output.
  - Updated table format for input activity CSVs

Additionally there are a handful of other minor fixes and feature
enhancements since the previous release:

- Minor fixes to several chapters in the user's guide.
- Other minor bug fixes and runtime performance tweaks in the 3.0 framework.

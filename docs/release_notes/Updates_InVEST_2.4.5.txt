This minor release of InVEST introduces major changes to the InVEST 3.0 Beta
Pollination model:
  - Greatly improved memory efficiency over previous versions of this model.
  - 3.0 Beta Pollination Biophysical and Valuation have been merged into a 
    single tool, run through a unified user interface.
  - Slightly improved runtime through the use of newer core InVEST GIS libraries.
  - Optional ability to weight different species individually.  This feature
    adds a column to the Guilds table that allows the user to specify a
    relative weight for each species, which will be used before combining all
    species supply rasters.
  - Optional ability to aggregate pollinator abundances at specific points
    provided by an optional points shapefile input.
  - Bugfix: non-agricultural pixels are set to a value of 0.0 to indicate no
    value on the farm value output raster.
  - Bugfix: sup_val_<beename>_<scenario>.tif rasters are now saved to the
    intermediate folder inside the user's workspace instead of the output
    folder.

Other improvements:
  - Better support for unicode filepaths in all 3.0 Beta user interfaces.
  - Improved state saving and retrieval when loading up previous-run parameters
    in all 3.0 Beta user interfaces.
  - All 3.0 Beta tools now report elapsed time on completion of a model.
  - All 3.0 Beta tools now provide disk space usage reports on completion of a
    model.
  - All 3.0 Beta tools now report arguments at the top of each logfile.
  - Carbon Biophysical 3.0 Beta:
    - Tweaked the user interface to require the user to
      provide a future LULC raster when the 'Calculate Sequestration' checkbox
      is checked.
    - Fixed a bug that restricted naming of harvest layers.  Harvest layers are
      now selected simply by taking the first available layer.
  - Biodiversity 3.0 Beta: The half-saturation constant is now allowed to be a
    positive floating-point number.
  - Timber 3.0 Beta: Validation has been added to the user interface for this
    tool for all tabular and shapefile inputs.

Improvements to the InVEST 2.x ArcGIS-based toolset:
  - Minor bugfix to Coastal Vulnerability, where an internal unit of
    measurements was off by a couple digits in the Fetch Calculator.
  - Minor fixes to various helper tools used in InVEST 2.x models.
  - Outputs for Hargreaves are now saved as geoTIFFs.
  - Thornwaite allows more flexible entring of hours of sunlight

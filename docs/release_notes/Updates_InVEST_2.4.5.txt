This is a minor release of InVEST that does not add any new models, but
does add additional functionality, stability, and increased performance to
many of the InVEST 3.0 standalones:

  - Pollination 3.0 Beta:
      - Greatly improved memory efficiency over previous versions of this model.
      - 3.0 Beta Pollination Biophysical and Valuation have been merged into a 
        single tool, run through a unified user interface.
      - Slightly improved runtime through the use of newer core InVEST GIS libraries.
      - Optional ability to weight different species individually.  This feature
        adds a column to the Guilds table that allows the user to specify a
        relative weight for each species, which will be used before combining all
        species supply rasters.
      - Optional ability to aggregate pollinator abundances at specific points
        provided by an optional points shapefile input.
      - Bugfix: non-agricultural pixels are set to a value of 0.0 to indicate no
        value on the farm value output raster.
      - Bugfix: sup_val_<beename>_<scenario>.tif rasters are now saved to the
        intermediate folder inside the user's workspace instead of the output
        folder.
  - Carbon Biophysical 3.0 Beta:
    - Tweaked the user interface to require the user to
      provide a future LULC raster when the 'Calculate Sequestration' checkbox
      is checked.
    - Fixed a bug that restricted naming of harvest layers.  Harvest layers are
      now selected simply by taking the first available layer.
  - Better memory efficiency in hydropower model.
  - Better support for unicode filepaths in all 3.0 Beta user interfaces.
  - Improved state saving and retrieval when loading up previous-run parameters
    in all 3.0 Beta user interfaces.
  - All 3.0 Beta tools now report elapsed time on completion of a model.
  - All 3.0 Beta tools now provide disk space usage reports on completion of a
    model.
  - All 3.0 Beta tools now report arguments at the top of each logfile.
  - Biodiversity 3.0 Beta: The half-saturation constant is now allowed to be a
    positive floating-point number.
  - Timber 3.0 Beta: Validation has been added to the user interface for this
    tool for all tabular and shapefile inputs.
  - Fixed some typos in Equation 1 in the Finfish Aquaculture user's guide.
  - Fixed a bug where start menu items were not getting deleted during an InVEST
    uninstall.
  - Added a feature so that if the user selects to download datasets but the
    datasets don't successfully download the installation alerts the user and
    continues normally.
  - Fixed a typo with tau in aquaculture guide, originally said 0.8, really 0.08.

  - Improvements to the InVEST 2.x ArcGIS-based toolset:
      - Minor bugfix to Coastal Vulnerability, where an internal unit of
        measurements was off by a couple digits in the Fetch Calculator.
      - Minor fixes to various helper tools used in InVEST 2.x models.
      - Outputs for Hargreaves are now saved as geoTIFFs.
      - Thornwaite allows more flexible entering of hours of sunlight.

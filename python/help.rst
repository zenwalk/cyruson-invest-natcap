This is the basic menu help.

There can even be multiple paragraphs.

.. _my-assessment-name:

How do you want to score criteria for the risk assessment?

.. _my-criteria:

Would you like to edit categories for scoring criteria?

The default categories are derived from peer-reviewed literature, and we recommend using these pre-established categories.  However, you have the option to edit categories for scoring criteria.  Only choose this option if the default categories for one or more criteria do not apply to your system or the questions you are trying to address with the risk assessment.  

.. _my-criteria-data:

Specify the 'data quality' categories.

For each exposure and consequence score, users have to option to indicate the quality of the data that was used to determine the score as best, adequate or limited. The model uses the data quality score to put greater weight on the criteria for which confidence is higher. 

'Unknown' = The quality of the data is unknown or the user does not wish to include differences in data quality in the calculation of risk.
'best' = substantial information is available to support the score and is based on data collected in the study region (or nearby) for the species in question.
'adequate' = Information is based on data collected outside the study region, may be based on related species, may represent moderate or insignificant statistical relationships.
'limited' = No empirical literature exists to justify scoring for the species but a reasonable inference can be made by the user.

.. _my-criteria-intensity:

Specify the 'stressor intensity' categories.

Here you have the option to change the categories you use to score stressor intensity. 

The intensity criterion is stressor-specific and the rank is relative to the other stressors within the study region. For example, the intensity of nutrient-loading stress associated with netpen salmon aquaculture is related to the number of salmon in the farm, and how much waste is released into the surrounding environment. Similarly, the intensity of destructive shellfish harvesting is related to the number of harvesters and the harvest practices.

.. _my-criteria-management:

Specify the 'management effectiveness' categories. 

Here you have the option to change the categories you use to score the effectiveness of management strategies for each stressor.

Management can limit the negative impacts of human activities on habitats. For example, policies that require salmon aquaculturists to let their farms lie fallow may reduce the amount of waste released and allow nearby seagrasses to recover. Similarly, regulations that require a minimum height for overwater structures reduce the shading impacts of overwater structures on submerged aquatic vegetation. Thus, effective management strategies will reduce the exposure of habitats to stressors. The effectiveness of management of each stressor is scored relative to other stressors in the region on a scale of 1-3. 

.. _my-criteria-area:

Specify the 'change in habitat area' categories.

Here you have the option to change the categories you use to score 'change in habitat area.'

Change in area is measured as the percent change in areal extent of a habitat when exposed to a given stressor and thus reflects the sensitivity of the habitat to the stressor. Habitats that lose a high percentage of their areal extent when exposed to a given stressor are highly sensitive, while those habitats that lose little area are less sensitive and more resistant.  

.. _my-criteria-structure:

Specify the 'change in habitat structure' categories. 

Here you have the option to change the categories you use to score 'change in habitat structure.'

For biotic habitats, the change in structure is the percentage change in structural density of the habitat when exposed to a given stressor. For example, change in structure would be the change in shoot density for seagrass systems, change in polyp density for corals, or change in stipe density for kelp systems. Habitats that lose a high percentage of their structure when exposed to a given stressor are highly sensitive, while habitats that lose little structure are less sensitive and more resistant. For abiotic habitats, the change in structure is the amount of structural damage sustained by the habitat. Sensitive abiotic habitats will sustain complete or partial damage, while those that sustain little to no damage are more resistant. For example, gravel or muddy bottoms will sustain partial or complete damage from bottom trawling while hard bedrock bottoms will sustain little to no damage.

.. _my-criteria-disturbance:

Specify the 'frequency of natural disturbance' categories. 

Here you have the option to change the categories you use to score 'frequency of natural disturbance.'

If a habitat is naturally frequently perturbed in a way similar to the anthropogenic stressor, it may be more resistant to additional anthropogenic stress. For example, habitats in areas that experience periodical delivery of nutrient subsidies (i.e. from upwelling or allocthonous inputs such as delivery of intertidal plant material to subtidal communities) are adapted to variable nutrient conditions and may be more resistant to nutrient loading from netpen salmon aquaculture. This criterion is scored separately for each habitat-stressor combination, such that being adapted to variable nutrient conditions increases resistance to nutrient loading from salmon aquaculture but not destructive fishing. However, high storm frequency may increase resistance to destructive fishing, because both stressors impact habitats in similar ways.

.. _my-criteria-overlap:

Specify the 'temporal overlap' categories.

Here you have the option to change the categories you use to score temporal overlap.  For example, you could change to 0-1 month, 2-10 months, 11-12 months.   

Temporal overlap is the duration of time that the habitat and the stressor experience spatial overlap. Some stressors, such as permanent overwater structures, are present year-round; others are seasonal, such as certain fishing practices. Similarly, some habitats (e.g. mangroves) are present year round, while others are more ephemeral (e.g. some seagrasses). Thus, even if a stressor is present year-round, such as overwater strucures, if the habitat is only present for six months of the year, the temporal overlap would be six months.  

.. _my-criteria-mortality:

Specify the 'natural mortality rate' categories. 

Here you have the option to change the categories you use to score natural mortality rate for biotic habitats.

Life history traits, such as natural mortality rate, influence the ability of habitats to recover from disturbance. Habitats with high natural mortality rates are generally more productive and more capable of recovery. This criterion only applies to biotic habitats.  

.. _my-criteria-recruitment:

Specify the 'natural recruitment rate' categories. 

Here you have the option to change the categories you use to score natural recruitment rate for biotic habitats.

Life history traits, such as natural recruitment rate, influence the ability of habitats to recover from disturbance. Frequent recruitment increases recovery potential by increasing the chance that incoming propagules can re-establish a population in a disturbed area. This criterion only applies to biotic habitats.

.. _my-criteria-connectivity:

Specify the 'connectivity' categories.

Here you have the option to change the categories you use to score connectivity for biotic habitats.

Life history traits, such as connectivity, influence the ability of habitats to recover from disturbance. Larval dispersal and close spacing of habitat patches increases the recovery potential of a habitat by increasing the chance that incoming propagules can re-establish a population in a disturbed area. This criterion only applies to biotic habitats.  

.. _my-criteria-recovery:

Specify the 'age at maturity/recovery time' categories.  

Here you have the option to change the categories you use to score age at maturity/recovery time.

Biotic habitats that reach maturity earlier are likely to be able to recover more quickly from disturbance than those that take longer to reach maturity.  Here we refer to maturity of the habitat as a whole (i.e., a mature kelp forest) rather than reproductive maturity of individuals.  For abiotic habitats, shorter recovery times for habitats such as mudflats decrease the consequences of exposure to human activities. In contrast, habitats made of bedrock will only recover on geological time scales, greatly increasing the consequences of exposure.

.. _my-data:

Would you like to edit the data?

Choose 'yes' to enter or change the number and names of stressors and habitats and the scores for any of the exposure and consequence criteria.  These data are required to run the model. Choose 'no' if you are satisified with the data you imported or the sample data.  

.. _my-data-habitats-stressors:

Specify the number of habitats and stressors.

.. _my-data-habitat-names:

.. _my-data-stressor-names:

Specify names for the stressors.

Remember, you are required to input a shapefile for each stressor in the ArcGIS interface in order to run the model. Data quality is an optional input.

.. _my-data-intensity:

Specify stressor intensity.

The intensity criterion is stressor-specific and the rank is relative to the other stressors within the study region. For example, the intensity of nutrient-loading stress associated with netpen salmon aquaculture is related to the number of salmon in the farm, and how much waste is released into the surrounding environment. Similarly, the intensity of destructive shellfish harvesting is related to the number of harvesters and the harvest practices. Choose 'no score' to exclude this criterion from your assessment. Data quality is an optional input.
.. _my-data-management:

Specify stressor management effectiveness.

Management can limit the negative impacts of human activities on habitats. For example, policies that require salmon aquaculturists to let their farms lie fallow may reduce the amount of waste released and allow nearby seagrasses to recover. Similarly, regulations that require a minimum height for overwater structures reduce the shading impacts of overwater structures on submerged aquatic vegetation. Thus, effective management strategies will reduce the exposure of habitats to stressors. The effectiveness of management of each stressor is scored relative to other stressors in the region on a scale of 1-3. Choose 'no score' to exclude this criterion. Data quality is an optional input.

.. _my-data-distance:

Specify the zone of influence for each stressor.

The zone of influence is the distance over which the stressor spreads beyond the footprint of the stressor indicated in the stressor shapefile.

.. _my-data-area:

Specify the change in habitat area when exposed to each stressor.

Change in area is measured as the percent change in areal extent of a habitat when exposed to a given stressor and thus reflects the sensitivity of the habitat to the stressor. Habitats that lose a high percentage of their areal extent when exposed to a given stressor are highly sensitive, while those habitats that lose little area are less sensitive and more resistant. Choose 'no score' to exclude this criteria from your assessment. Data quality is an optional input.

.. _my-data-structure:

Specify the change in habitat structure when exposed to each stressor.

For biotic habitats, the change in structure is the percentage change in structural density of the habitat when exposed to a given stressor. For example, change in structure would be the change in shoot density for seagrass systems, change in polyp density for corals, or change in stipe density for kelp systems. Habitats that lose a high percentage of their structure when exposed to a given stressor are highly sensitive, while habitats that lose little structure are less sensitive and more resistant. For abiotic habitats, the change in structure is the amount of structural damage sustained by the habitat. Sensitive abiotic habitats will sustain complete or partial damage, while those that sustain little to no damage are more resistant. For example, gravel or muddy bottoms will sustain partial or complete damage from bottom trawling while hard bedrock bottoms will sustain little to no damage. Choose 'no score' to exclude this criterion from your assessment. Data quality is an optional input.
.. _my-data-disturbance:

For each habitat, specify the frequency of the natural disturbance that is most similar to each of the following stressors. 

If a habitat is naturally frequently perturbed in a way similar to the anthropogenic stressor, it may be more resistant to additional anthropogenic stress. For example, habitats in areas that experience periodical delivery of nutrient subsidies (i.e. from upwelling or allocthonous inputs such as delivery of intertidal plant material to subtidal communities) are adapted to variable nutrient conditions and may be more resistant to nutrient loading from netpen salmon aquaculture. This criterion is scored separately for each habitat-stressor combination, such that being adapted to variable nutrient conditions increases resistance to nutrient loading from salmon aquaculture but not destructive fishing. However, high storm frequency may increase resistance to destructive fishing, because both stressors impact habitats in similar ways. Choose 'no score' to exclude this criterion from your assessment. Data quality is an optional input.

.. _my-data-time:

For each habitat, specify the amount of time that the stressor and habitat come into contact.

Temporal overlap is the duration of time that the habitat and the stressor experience spatial overlap. Some stressors, such as permanent overwater structures, are present year-round; others are seasonal, such as certain fishing practices. Similarly, some habitats (e.g. mangroves) are present year round, while others are more ephemeral (e.g. some seagrasses). Thus, temporal overlap refers to the period during which both the habitat and the stressor are present and overlap in space. Choose 'no score' to exclude this criterion from your assessment. Data quality is an optional input.

.. _my-data-mortality:

Specify natural mortality rate.

Life history traits, such as natural mortality rate, influence the ability of habitats to recover from disturbance. Habitats with high natural mortality rates are generally more productive and more capable of recovery. This criterion only applies to biotic habitats.  Choose no score for abiotic habitats. Choose 'no score' to exclude this criterion from your assessment. Data quality is an optional input.

.. _my-data-recruitment:

Specify natural recruitment rate. 

Life history traits, such as natural recruitment rate, influence the ability of habitats to recover from disturbance. Frequent recruitment increases recovery potential by increasing the chance that incoming propagules can re-establish a population in a disturbed area. This criterion only applies to biotic habitats. Choose 'no score' for abiotic habitats or to exclude this criterion from your assessment. Data quality is an optional input.

.. _my-data-connectivity:

Specify connectivity.

Life history traits, such as connectivity, influence the ability of habitats to recover from disturbance. Larval dispersal and close spacing of habitat patches increases the recovery potential of a habitat by increasing the chance that incoming propagules can re-establish a population in a disturbed area. This criterion only applies to biotic habitats. Choose 'no score' for abiotic habitats or to exclude this criterion from your assessment. Data quality is an optional input.

.. _my-data-recovery:

Specify age at maturity (biotic habitats) or recovery time (abiotic habitats). 

Biotic habitats that reach maturity earlier are likely to be able to recover more quickly from disturbance than those that take longer to reach maturity.  Here we refer to maturity of the habitat as a whole (i.e., a mature kelp forest) rather than reproductive maturity of individuals.  For abiotic habitats, shorter recovery times for habitats such as mudflats decrease the consequences of exposure to human activities. In contrast, habitats made of bedrock will only recover on geological time scales, greatly increasing the consequences of exposure. Choose 'no score' to exclude this criteria from your assessment. Data quality is an optional input.
